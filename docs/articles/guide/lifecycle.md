# Component Lifecycle

Components are plain Go structs backed by an `HTMLComponent`. They move
through three predictable phases which mirror the DOM element they wrap.

## Mount

`Render()` runs and the generated DOM is inserted into the page. The
optional `OnMount` hook is called after insertion; start timers or fetch
remote data here. Hooks can be registered without defining a custom struct by
calling `WithLifecycle`, `SetOnMount`, or `SetOnUnmount` on the returned
`HTMLComponent`.

## Update

Reactive state changes trigger DOM patches automatically. Watchers and
computed values let you react to data changes without writing manual
listeners. Use the `OnUpdate` hook for side effects that should run after
each render.

## Unmount

Before a component disappears the `OnUnmount` hook fires. Clean up
subscriptions, close channels or stop timers to avoid leaks.

The lifecycle is deterministic and relies solely on Go â€“ no JavaScript
framework code runs on the client besides the small runtime generated by
rfw.
Lifecycle hooks run as components mount and unmount.
