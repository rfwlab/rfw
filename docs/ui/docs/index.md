# Introduction

rfw is a reactive framework written in Go and compiled to WebAssembly. It focuses on a direct binding model between state and the DOM, avoiding virtual DOM diffing and embracing an eventâ€‘driven architecture. The project is experimental and aims to provide a pleasant way to build web interfaces with Go.
